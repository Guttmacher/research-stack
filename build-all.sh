# Build all combinations: 2 architectures √ó 2 targets = 4 images
# Builds: full-container and r-container for both arm64 and amd64
#
# WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS:
# Docker containers are platform-specific (arm64 vs amd64). When you build a container
# on an Apple Silicon Mac, it creates an arm64 image. When you build on an Intel Mac
# or most cloud servers, it creates an amd64 image. This script builds both versions
# of both container types, so you have local images for testing regardless of your platform.
#
# WHY WE BUILD LOCALLY INSTEAD OF USING MULTI-PLATFORM:
# Multi-platform builds (docker buildx --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64) can only
# push directly to a registry - they can't create local images you can test with
# "docker run". This script creates local images with clear names like:
# - full-container-arm64 (for Apple Silicon)
# - full-container-amd64 (for Intel/cloud)
# - r-container-arm64
# - r-container-amd64

# Exit immediately if any command fails (fail-fast behavior)
# NOTE: In parallel mode, background processes (&) are not affected by set -e
# We handle their failures explicitly with wait and exit code checking
set -e

# These arrays define what we're building - 2 targets √ó 2 platforms = 4 total images
